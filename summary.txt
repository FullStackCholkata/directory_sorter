1. Start by importing necessary modules
    os and shutil modules will be essential
    Consider pathlib for more modern path handling

2. Set up your source directory (downloads folder)
    How will you specify this path?
    Think about making it work across different operating systems

3. Define your destination categories
    What categories do you want? (Images, Documents, Videos, etc.)
    What file extensions belong in each category?

4. Scan the downloads directory
    How can you get a list of all files?
    How will you ignore subdirectories?

5. For each file, determine its category
    How will you extract the file extension?
    How will you match it to the right category?

6. Create destination folders if they don't exist
    How can you check if a directory exists?
    How do you create a directory?

7. Move the files to their appropriate folders
    What happens if a file with the same name already exists?
    How will you handle permission errors?

8. Add logging or feedback
    How will you know what files were moved where?
